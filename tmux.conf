# By default, all windows in a session are constrained to the size of the
# smallest client connected to that session, even if both clients are looking at
# different windows. It seems that in this particular case, Screen has the better
# default where a window is only constrained in size if a smaller client is
# actively looking at it. This behaviour can be fixed by setting tmux's
# aggressive-resize option.
